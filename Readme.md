# About the Game

### Overview
Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The game involves comparing cards between one or more players and a dealer. The primary objective is to beat the dealer without going over 21 points. Here are the basic rules of Blackjack:

### Object of the Game:
- Beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21.

### Card Values:
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.

### The Deal:
1. Each player, including the dealer, is dealt two cards.
2. Players' cards are usually dealt face-up, while one of the dealer's cards is dealt face-up (upcard), and the other is dealt face-down (hole card).

### Player's Turn:
1. **Hit:** Take another card to increase the hand's total.
2. **Stand:** Keep the current hand and end the turn.
3. **Double Down:** Double the initial bet, take one more card, and then stand.
4. **Split:** If the first two cards are of the same rank, split them into two separate hands, each with its own bet.

### Dealer's Turn:
- The dealer reveals the hole card.
- The dealer must hit until the hand totals 17 or higher.
- The dealer hits on a "soft 17" (a hand containing an Ace counted as 11).

### Winning and Losing:
- If the player's hand exceeds 21 points, they bust and lose the bet.
- If the dealer busts, the player wins.
- If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the hand with a total closest to 21 wins.
- Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) is the strongest hand (pays 3:2). 

### Push (Tie):
- If the player and dealer have the same total, it's a push, and the player's bet is returned.

### Insurance:
- If the dealer's upcard is an Ace, players may have the option to buy insurance. This is a side bet that pays 2:1 if the dealer has a Blackjack.


# Basic Strategy

### Hard Totals (No Ace):
- Always hit on totals of 8 or less.
- Stand on totals of 17 or more.
- Double down on totals of 10 or 11 if the dealer has a 2-9.
- Otherwise, hit.

### Soft Totals (With Ace):
- Always hit soft 17 or less.
- Double down on soft 13-18 if the dealer has a 5-6.
- Otherwise, hit.

### Pairs:
- Always split Aces and 8s.
- Never split 5s and 10s.
- Split 2s and 3s when the dealer has 4-7.
- Split 4s only if the dealer has 5 or 6.
- Split 6s when the dealer has 3-6.
- Split 7s when the dealer has 2-7.
- Split 9s when the dealer has 2-6, 8-9.

### Doubling Down:
- Double down on 9 against dealer's 3-6.
- Double down on 10 against dealer's 2-9.
- Double down on 11 against dealer's 2-10.
- Avoid doubling on soft hands against strong dealer cards.
